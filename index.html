    I am a student at UTAA. My research focuses on the interaction of algorithms and networks, and the roles they play in large-scale social and information systems. My work has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young
    Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur
    Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
